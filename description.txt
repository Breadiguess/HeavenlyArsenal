I have long felt that WoTG has been too weaponless, and this is my attempt to fix that.
thank you all :3

credit where it's due: 
Thank you to lucille for providing code and content (Shuuren, Brutal Forgiveness, Roche limit)
Thank you to Blockaroz for not only the content (Flyrift, Avatar Spear), but also the constant support and aid rendered for all manner of bugs
Thank you to Bobulous and Pil for the various textures and sprites
Thank you to Stardustink and Origamiskies for the concept art of various weapons, locations
Thank you to Multieye for the music and sound effects

and thank you to you, the community. This mod wouldn't exist without all of you!
