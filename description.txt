I have long felt that WoTG has been too weaponless, and this is my attempt to fix that.
currently, the mod includes:
two armor sets, one post yharon and the other post avatar
one vanity set
three magic weapons
two melee weapons
two ranged weapons (both still work in progress)
two summon weapons
one whip
three unique accessories, with three more still in development
six unique enemies, with a few more still in development
one consumable item

thank you all :3
