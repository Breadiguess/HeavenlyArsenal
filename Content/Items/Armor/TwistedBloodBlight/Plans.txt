Twisted Bloodblight

Twisted Bloodblight is a living, parasitic armor set that forms a symbiotic bond with its wearer.
It does not simply increase stats — it responds to bloodshed, adapts to combat stress, and asserts control when pushed too far.

Core Mechanic — Blood Saturation
Combat generates Blood Saturation, a resource that ranges from 0–100.
Dealing damage increases saturation
Taking damage increases saturation
Prolonged combat accelerates saturation
Leaving combat causes saturation to decay
As Blood Saturation rises, the armor mutates its behavior.
Saturation Bands
Band	State	Description
0–30%	Dormant	Defensive, restrained, stable
30–70%	Symbiosis	Peak cooperation, active abilities
70–100%	Ascension	Extreme power, heavy risk

Remaining at high saturation for too long causes a Crash, forcibly weakening the player.
Class Morphs
Twisted Bloodblight adapts to the player’s dominant damage class:

Melee – Blood limbs, grapples, butcher form
Ranger – Blood tracers, chaining projectiles, Blood Cannons
Mage – Hemal sigils, autonomous spellcasting
Summoner – Blood thralls, Overmind
Rogue – blood phantoms, stealth strikes claw enemies, 
Morphs can shift dynamically during combat.
